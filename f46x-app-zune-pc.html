Чтобы предоставить вам эти сведения как можно. So i have a zune that's pretty old, probably bought it around 2007. Since then, I've gotten a different computer, a Macbook, and it's seemingly impossible to get music from a Zune onto a Mac. I have an old Dell, but it's basically spare parts at this point. Anyone know how to get my beloved music collection off this Zune? Thank.

They have a few decent servers, but the majority of their work is done on donated workstations (sometimes powerful multi-CPU models, sometimes not so great) to analyse genomes. If you've never seen a genome, each sequence results in TB's of data and it takes a long time to run. Weeks, on some of the more complicated runs.

Many of us on here adore our Windows Phones and despite the doomed state we have stuck with the beloved platform, even though Microsoft never cared to give us one ounce of attention throughout the past few years. Sure they are obligated to provide security updates, but that is just a mere feeble attempt to make themselves look technologically and socially responsible.

Ok first of all if you aren't familiar with the concept of Flat Design or Swiss design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design You've definitely used something made with flat design, be it Windows, and iPhone, or a website, there is no escaping it. It's the current bandwagon design trend of a minimized interface, 2D or flat objects, and limited color that everyone seems to be jumping on lately.

As with many other people who I'm sure have vented on this subreddit, I have been a loyal fan to the Windows Mobile platform and now feel utterly betrayed. However this betrayal is new, well, for me at least. Despite the announcement that "Windows 10 Mobile" is dead, I held out faith that a new "One Core" mobile platform would soon be released (e.g. The Andromeda device). But I think I'm finally done with holding out any hope, and it's not because off some analyst online, comments on reddit

I've been using my Zune because I still have it and love it but It doesn't let me change playback speed. I love the option on the android app (2 months 11 days time listened on the app stats) and would love to find a device that works well with audible manager on PC but has an option for speeding up playback. Fyi: I dont love the idea of permanently changing the track speed before uploading. Thanks. 
So I switched from my 950XL to my Huawei P9 once before and after two months I switched back to my 950XL. I got fed up again with my 950XL for some reason a while ago and switched back to the P9. After a couple of months with the P9 I just swapped back again tonight. Last time I switched it was because I was fed up with bugs and slow loading apps. There were also a couple of apps I wanted that were not on W10M. I went through the process once again with the P9 loading different keyboards Hi guys, No idea if I put this in the correct snubreddit but oh well. Anyway, Ive been getting very eager to get my own PC for gaming but lets say if I build a computer for around 2,500-30,000 dollars then would it be better to use a computer like that only for gaming and use a weaker and cheaper computer for internet browsing and all of that? Also by friend says that I should get an xbox one x box because it better, hes now face down in a dumpster. How do you guys with your own computers Edit (after 2 hours of posting): - Think big, not only about the OS itselve and the functionalities but also how you would run the department so you'll get a better product and bigger marketshare. - What would your vision be for W10M in the next 5 years? Edit (after 19 hours after posting): I decided to bring all your input together and catagorize it a bit. Think most of us do agree on a lot of things. Thank you all, this was an amazing AskWindowsPhone! # Visions. I have had my Project Scorpio edition X since day one, obviously, with no issues. This evening it started acting up. It was working fine to stream video, but then started lagging. I thought it was the crappy Spectrum app at first, but then I found the whole Xbox interface was lagging. I then went to do a hard reboot, had the same issue. Tried this a few times and started getting some beeping from the console and noticed it was pretty hot. Tried disconnecting all cables for 5-10 minutes Hi folks. I've been developing a Zune-like Music Player System for Windows Phone for about 3-4 years now. Ever since MS killed the Zune, I knew I needed a replacement eventually, and I decided Windows Phone needed functionality as good as or better than the original Zune. Well, WP7 couldn't do what I needed it to, so I put it on hold. When WP8 came out I started again, but ran into roadblocks there too. WP8.1 helped a lot but I was sidetracked by life. Finally, UWP/WP10 is out, and I'm findin. Hey /r/windowsphone/ I'm an app developer with a few apps on both the Windows Phone and Windows 8 stores and am currently between projects. With that said, I thought it'd be fun to throw my time out to the community. I've got more than a week before I'll start on my other projects and so I want to spend that time doing something cool. The issue is that all of the apps that I have ideas for are, to put it plainly, massive. Anyway, here's what I'm going to do. I'm looking for app suggestions. Hello, I need some help with Groove. Suddenly it stopped working and wont play any song that comes with the Groove Pass. When I try to play a song it loads for a moment and then a message error appears that says: “Can't Play The item is missing or we can't get to it. 0x80070002”. It only happens with music included in the Groove Pass, no matter if the song has downloaded in my PC or playing via streaming, it gives me the same error. Songs from Onedrive or local files work fine. I have tried. Up until this morning I was still able to access the marketplace, download music using my subscription and sync it to my zune using the zune software for PC. As of this morning, the zune software required a close on all of my PCs and upon restarting the martketplace is gone. Goodnight sweet prince =( Edit: So it looks like if you use the groove app to download songs with your subscription, it adds them to your music folder on Windows. Unfortunately the DRM on songs from the Groove app prevent. Just found an old 30gb Zune at my SO's parents house and i'm trying to get it up and running, when I plugged it into my desktop (windows 10) the Zune would show up in device manager under portable devices but wouldn't show in windows media player or explorer. I then installed the Zune software from Microsoft's (version 4.8 I think if that makes a difference) website but now when I plug the Zune in it does not show up anywhere, there are no unknown devices in my device manager 
Lets say you have to immediately switch to another OS. You can never go back to Windows Phone. What are you going to miss the most about having one? The biggest reasons for me are these: The awesome UI. Seriously, UWP is so beautiful, and seeing my phone and PC live in the same ecosystem, almost like they're the same thing looks so sci-fi. I love that. The apps. Yes, the apps. iOS and Android have much more apps, but quantity doesn't mean shit. MyTube! and Baconit are my favourite Let's be honest. The other platforms have always been more mature than Windows Phone. Nobody would pick Windows Phone unless they had a good reason to do so. As Windows Phone users, we get treated as second-class citizens. We don't get most of the popular and cool apps until it's too late. We are the last to get app updates, if any. We have to rely on a handful of developers (Rudy Huyn) to get the most basic apps. People laugh when they hear "Windows Phone". It's like we don't exist. I pulled my old HD7 out of the drawer today. I thought the battery was shot and wouldn't charge, but tried anyway, and sure enough, it worked. I was curious to see how much different the old Zune player one WP7 was compared to Xbox Music on 8.1. I loaded it up with some music (good thing I still have Zune on my PC), and gave it a spin. It is surprisingly fast considering how old this phone is and how underpowered it is compared to modern phones. What I also immediately noticed is the screen. I mean we are in 2016, more and more people have a good internet connection enough to stream or download big file in a few times. While Microsoft already propose Groove to buy music, Movies to buy movies and TV shows. The tendancy of The moment is The stream, we have Netflix and Hulu, Spotify and Apple Music, . and for The gaming we have PS Now, G cluster, Nvidia or GameFly (for The cloud gaming) and EA Acces or Origin Acces (You have a store and you can play/download a game). 
Dont get me wrong, Im a Windows user through and through. PC's tablets, phones (Ive got three Windows phones on my desk in front of me right now). But Microsoft give their products stupid names. They're not trendy, cool, catchy or modern at all. Its like they're thought up by 50 year old marketing executives trying to sound cool. Xbox: "Hey, X is cool. Its like Xtreme or to the Max. Kids like extreme things don't they?" Yeah, maybe in the 90's! Kinect: What sort of stupid name is that? Projec. First of all: this post isn't meant in a bad way, these are just consideration I'm making before switching to Android. My first proper smartphone was an Omnia 7, back with WP7. It was decent at the time, almost no apps, but still. System was fresh, I hated (now I don't, but I still wouldn't buy) Apple and to a lesser extent Android. Apple for being overpriced and Android because, not knowing it, I considered as a bad copy of iOS. Lack of apps wasn't an issue, and I loved the smoothness Zune is a discontinued media management software for Microsoft Windows that functions as a full media player application with a library, an interface Microsoft arr te la commercialisation des lecteurs Zune en octobre 2011 4  En juin 2012, Microsoft annonce qu'il arr te tous les services Zune au profit.
